# Gbot-pheno

Complete documentation of the robotic platform for phenotyping soybean crops GBOT-PHENO

# Overview

The main goal of this project it's provide a tool for phenotipyng soybeans crops at low cost using a robotic platform. We created this tool to obtain estimate yield using IA algorithms.

We obtain yield measuring (at R8 stage) pods numbers, seeds number and weigth. The IA algorithms
